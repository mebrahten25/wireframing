# Wireframing

## Introduction
Wireframing is a crucial step in the design process that involves creating a simplified visual representation of a website, application, or software interface. It acts as a blueprint that outlines the layout, structure, and functionality of a product before full-scale development begins.

## Importance of Wireframing
- **Clarifies Design Concepts**: Helps designers, developers, and stakeholders visualize ideas and structure early on.
- **Saves Time and Costs**: Identifies potential issues and allows for easy modifications before development, reducing rework.
- **Enhances Communication**: Provides a common reference point for teams to discuss design decisions and user experience.
- **Focus on User Experience**: Prioritizes content placement, navigation flow, and usability without being distracted by visual styling.

Wireframes can be created using simple sketches, digital tools, or specialized wireframing software. They serve as the foundation for prototypes and final designs, ensuring the project meets user needs efficiently.
